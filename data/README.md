## README

- `lisjournals.bib` : the original data file from *Scopus*
- lisJournals_no_translations.bib : this file was used for data analysis. I removed translations of article titles and kept the English version only when there was an English version. If there was not an English version, I kept the title in its original language
* all other files were generated using R
